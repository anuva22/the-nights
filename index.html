    <h2>Its All About A Song By <span class="orange-highlight">AVICII</span></h2>
    <h3>I had a dream so big and loud</h3>
    <p>Once upon a younger year ,When all our shadows disappeared.The animals inside came out to play.Went face to face with all our fears.Learned our lessons through the tears .Made memories we knew would never fade</p>

            He took me in his arms, I heard him say
            "When you get older
            Your wild heart will live for younger days
            Think of me if ever you're afraid"</p>
